  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <div class="flex-container">
    <div class="text-box">
      <p>Floods are among the most frequent and destructive natural disasters in Sri Lanka, affecting thousands of lives and causing severe economic and infrastructural damage annually. The Gampaha District, situated in the wet zone of the country, is particularly vulnerable due to its dense population, rapid urbanization, and exposure to both the southwest and northeast monsoons. One of the most flood-prone areas within this district is the Attanagalu Oya river basin, which frequently overflows during intense rainfall, inundating low-lying Grama Niladhari (GN) divisions.

      <br/>In response to these recurring threats, this research project aims to develop a machine learning (ML)-based flood area prediction model that leverages local environmental and hydrological data. By integrating features such as river water levels, rainfall intensity, and the distance of GN divisions from the river, the model classifies areas as either flood-prone or not. The system is designed not only to enhance the accuracy and timeliness of early flood warnings but also to support better disaster preparedness, resource allocation, and community resilience planning.</p>

  <section id="about">
    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
      The Attanagalu Oya Basin, located in the Gampaha District of Sri Lanka, spans approximately 727 kmÂ² and is highly susceptible to seasonal flooding due to both monsoonal rainfall and inadequate drainage infrastructure. This area has historically faced severe disruptions in residential areas, transportation routes, and agricultural zones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our project focuses on developing a flood prediction model using supervised machine learning techniques. We utilized environmental and hydrological data from 2016 onward, collected from official sources including the Sri Lanka Irrigation Department, Disaster Management Centre (DMC), and the Department of Meteorology. The core predictive features include rainfall levels, river water levels, and the geographical distance of each GN division from the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      The model is trained and tested using data from <strong>102 Grama Niladhari (GN) divisions</strong> across the basin. These divisions were manually digitized, cleaned, and used as location references in our analysis to enable precise, zone-level flood risk classification.

  <section id="methodology">
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>
      This research follows a structured, data-driven methodology to develop and evaluate a machine learning-based flood prediction model for the Gampaha District. The approach can be summarized into the following key phases:
    </p>

    <h3>1. Data Collection</h3>
    <p>
      Historical data spanning from 2016 to 2024 was collected from multiple government institutions:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Irrigation Department:</strong> River water level readings from key gauging stations on the Attanagalu Oya (e.g., Dunamale).</li>
        <li><strong>Meteorology Department:</strong> Daily rainfall records in the Gampaha District.</li>
        <li><strong>Disaster Management Centre (DMC):</strong> Past flood incident logs at the GN division level.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>2. Data Digitization & Preprocessing</h3>
    <p>
      Most historical flood records were in paper format and required manual transcription. Once digitized, the data was cleaned using Python's <code>pandas</code> library:
      <ul>
        <li>Standardized timestamps (e.g., converting all date formats to YYYY-MM-DD).</li>
        <li>Removed inconsistencies in GN division names and merged duplicate entries.</li>
        <li>Interpolated or forward-filled missing water level and rainfall values where appropriate.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>3. Feature Engineering</h3>
    <p>
      The final dataset contained records for 102 GN divisions with the following features:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rainfall (mm):</strong> Total daily rainfall recorded in the basin.</li>
        <li><strong>Water Level (m):</strong> River water level from the Dunamale gauge station.</li>
        <li><strong>Distance to River (km):</strong> Approximate linear distance from each GN division to Attanagalu Oya, categorized into risk zones (High, Medium, Low).</li>
      </ul>
      Each record was labeled with a binary output:
      <strong>1</strong> for flood occurrence and <strong>0</strong> for no flood.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Model Development</h3>
    <p>
      Three supervised machine learning models were trained and evaluated:
      <ul>
        <li><span class="badge">Support Vector Machine (SVM)</span></li>
        <li><span class="badge">Random Forest (RF)</span></li>
        <li><span class="badge">XGBoost (Gradient Boosting)</span></li>
      </ul>
      The models were trained using an 80/20 train-test split and validated using cross-validation techniques.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Evaluation</h3>
    <p>
      Each model was assessed using standard classification metrics:
      <ul>
        <li>Accuracy</li>
        <li>Precision</li>
        <li>Recall</li>
        <li>F1-Score</li>
        <li>ROC-AUC Curve</li>
      </ul>
      The model with the best trade-off between precision and recall will be selected for future deployment in a real-time early warning system.
    </p>

    <h2>Results</h2>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p>Initial testing revealed that <strong>Random Forest</strong> and <strong>XGBoost</strong> outperformed Support Vector Machine (SVM) in overall predictive performance. After thorough evaluation, <strong>XGBoost</strong> was selected as the final model for deployment due to its superior accuracy and balanced performance across all metrics.</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Model evaluation was conducted using multiple classification metrics including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score. Additionally, confusion matrices were generated to visualize the classification results and identify the distribution of true vs. predicted values for both flood and non-flood scenarios.

    <p>
      Based on evaluation, <strong>XGBoost</strong> demonstrated the best balance between minimizing false positives (predicting flood where there was none) and maximizing true positives (correctly identifying actual flood events). Its higher precision and recall made it the ideal choice for integration into a real-time flood early warning system for the Gampaha District.
    </p>

  <section id="discussion">
    <h2>Discussion</h2>

    <p>
      The application of machine learning models for flood prediction in the Attanagalu Oya basin demonstrates the potential for data-driven technologies to support disaster preparedness and risk reduction. Among the models tested, <strong>XGBoost</strong> consistently outperformed others in terms of classification accuracy, precision, and recall, ultimately making it the most suitable model for real-world implementation.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the key advantages of XGBoost lies in its ability to handle imbalanced datasets and uncover non-linear patterns in multi-dimensional data. This is particularly important in flood forecasting, where flood events are less frequent than non-flood days, and environmental conditions vary significantly across locations and seasons.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, incorporating spatial features such as the GN division's proximity to the river (distance to Attanagalu Oya) enabled the model to account for geographical vulnerabilities. This approach marks an improvement over traditional rainfall-threshold-based warnings, which often ignore localized topographic and hydrologic characteristics.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite these successes, several limitations were observed. Some flood records were incomplete or inconsistently recorded across different departments. Moreover, the current model relies on historical data and does not yet integrate real-time sensor data or satellite imagery, which could further improve prediction speed and accuracy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Future enhancements could include:
      <ul>
        <li>Integrating live rainfall, river gauge, and IoT-based flood sensors for real-time inference</li>
        <li>Improving GN-level geolocation accuracy using GIS-based datasets</li>
        <li>Using ensemble or hybrid models for further accuracy improvements</li>
        <li>Deploying the model as a web API or embedding it into early warning dashboards</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Ultimately, the system has the potential to assist local authorities, first responders, and community stakeholders by providing early flood alerts at GN-level granularity. This supports faster evacuations, better resource planning, and improved resilience in flood-prone communities.
