  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <div class="flex-container">
    <div class="text-box">
      <p>Floods are among the most frequent and destructive natural disasters in Sri Lanka, affecting thousands of lives and causing severe economic and infrastructural damage annually. The Gampaha District, situated in the wet zone of the country, is particularly vulnerable due to its dense population, rapid urbanization, and exposure to both the southwest and northeast monsoons. One of the most flood-prone areas within this district is the Attanagalu Oya river basin, which frequently overflows during intense rainfall, inundating low-lying Grama Niladhari (GN) divisions.

      <br/>In response to these recurring threats, this research project aims to develop a machine learning (ML)-based flood area prediction model that leverages local environmental and hydrological data. By integrating features such as river water levels, rainfall intensity, and the distance of GN divisions from the river, the model classifies areas as either flood-prone or not. The system is designed not only to enhance the accuracy and timeliness of early flood warnings but also to support better disaster preparedness, resource allocation, and community resilience planning.</p>

  <section id="about">
    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
      The Attanagalu Oya Basin, located in the Gampaha District of Sri Lanka, spans approximately 727 km² and is highly susceptible to seasonal flooding due to both monsoonal rainfall and inadequate drainage infrastructure. This area has historically faced severe disruptions in residential areas, transportation routes, and agricultural zones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our project focuses on developing a flood prediction model using supervised machine learning techniques. We utilized environmental and hydrological data from 2016 onward, collected from official sources including the Sri Lanka Irrigation Department, Disaster Management Centre (DMC), and the Department of Meteorology. The core predictive features include rainfall levels, river water levels, and the geographical distance of each GN division from the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      The model is trained and tested using data from <strong>102 Grama Niladhari (GN) divisions</strong> across the basin. These divisions were manually digitized, cleaned, and used as location references in our analysis to enable precise, zone-level flood risk classification.

  <section id="methodology">
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>
      This research follows a structured, data-driven methodology to develop and evaluate a machine learning-based flood prediction model for the Gampaha District. The approach can be summarized into the following key phases:
    </p>

    <h3>1. Data Collection</h3>
    <p>
      Historical data spanning from 2016 to 2024 was collected from multiple government institutions:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Irrigation Department:</strong> River water level readings from key gauging stations on the Attanagalu Oya (e.g., Dunamale).</li>
        <li><strong>Meteorology Department:</strong> Daily rainfall records in the Gampaha District.</li>
        <li><strong>Disaster Management Centre (DMC):</strong> Past flood incident logs at the GN division level.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>2. Data Digitization & Preprocessing</h3>
    <p>
      Most historical flood records were in paper format and required manual transcription. Once digitized, the data was cleaned using Python's <code>pandas</code> library:
      <ul>
        <li>Standardized timestamps (e.g., converting all date formats to YYYY-MM-DD).</li>
        <li>Removed inconsistencies in GN division names and merged duplicate entries.</li>
        <li>Interpolated or forward-filled missing water level and rainfall values where appropriate.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>3. Feature Engineering</h3>
    <p>
      The final dataset contained records for 102 GN divisions with the following features:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rainfall (mm):</strong> Total daily rainfall recorded in the basin.</li>
        <li><strong>Water Level (m):</strong> River water level from the Dunamale gauge station.</li>
        <li><strong>Distance to River (km):</strong> Approximate linear distance from each GN division to Attanagalu Oya, categorized into risk zones (High, Medium, Low).</li>
      </ul>
      Each record was labeled with a binary output:
      <strong>1</strong> for flood occurrence and <strong>0</strong> for no flood.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Model Development</h3>
    <p>
      Three supervised machine learning models were trained and evaluated:
      <ul>
        <li><span class="badge">Support Vector Machine (SVM)</span></li>
        <li><span class="badge">Random Forest (RF)</span></li>
        <li><span class="badge">XGBoost (Gradient Boosting)</span></li>
      </ul>
      The models were trained using an 80/20 train-test split and validated using cross-validation techniques.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Evaluation</h3>
    <p>
      Each model was assessed using standard classification metrics:
      <ul>
        <li>Accuracy</li>
        <li>Precision</li>
        <li>Recall</li>
        <li>F1-Score</li>
        <li>ROC-AUC Curve</li>
      </ul>
      The model with the best trade-off between precision and recall will be selected for future deployment in a real-time early warning system.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p>Initial testing shows that <strong>Random Forest</strong> and <strong>XGBoost</strong> provided the highest accuracy in model evaluation.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Model performance was evaluated using confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves. Once testing is complete, the most accurate model will be selected for integration into a real-time flood early warning system.</p>

  <section id="discussion">
    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p>ML models like Random Forest and XGBoost outperform traditional static models in capturing flood risk due to their ability to learn from non-linear and multi-variable relationships. The inclusion of spatial features (distance to river) and hydrological data enhances prediction precision. Future plans involve integration of sensor networks and real-time alerts.</p>
    <!-- Suggestion: Add satellite image or schematic showing sensor placements -->
